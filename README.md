# Beyond-Borders

### About the Project
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
Beyond-Borders is a travel platform designed to simplify vacation planning, offering everything you need to create your perfect trip, from historic landmarks to family-friendly adventures.
</p>

### Motivation
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
The inspiration behind Beyond-Borders stems from a desire to help travelers overcome the hassle of trip planning. We wanted to create a platform that consolidates all essential travel information in one place, making it easier for people to explore the world and discover new experiences without the stress of juggling multiple tools and sources.
</p>

### Build Status

<p style="font-size: 12px;">
The current build of Beyond-Borders is functional but has a few known issues that require attention. These include:
</p>

- **Google Maps API Issue**: The API for Google Maps fails when an advertiser attempts to create an activity. 
- **Slow Fetching of Data**: Fetching data for hotels, flights, and all products can take longer than expected, affecting the user experience.
- **Step-by-Step Tutorial Button**: The open dialog button for the step-by-step tutorial is not immediately obvious to tourists or guests, potentially causing usability challenges.

### Code Style

Our code follows a clean and consistent coding style to ensure maintainability and readability for both backend and frontend code. 

#### Backend Code Style
- **Modular and Reusable Code**: Functions are modular to make them reusable across the application.
- **Clear Comments**: Each function and critical logic segment is well-documented with comments explaining their purpose.
- **Error Handling**: Backend APIs include robust error handling to address edge cases and provide meaningful feedback to users.
- **Consistent Variable Naming**: Variable names are written in `camelCase` to maintain consistency.
